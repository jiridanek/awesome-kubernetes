### Three New Functionalities

1. Self-Managing Platform
2. Application Lifecycle Management ([OLM](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/operators/understanding_olm/olm-understanding-olm.html)):
    - **OLM Operator**:
        - Responsible for deploying applications defined by [ClusterServiceVersion (CSV) manifest](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/operators/understanding_olm/olm-understanding-olm.html#olm-csv_olm-understanding-olm).
        - Not concerned with the creation of the required resources; users can choose to manually create these resources using the CLI, or  users can choose to create these resources using the Catalog Operator.
    - **Catalog Operator**:
        - Responsible for resolving and installing CSVs and the required resources they specify. It is also responsible for watching CatalogSources for updates to packages in channels and upgrading them (optionally automatically) to the latest available versions.
        - A user that wishes to track a package in a channel creates a **Subscription resource** configuring the desired **package, channel, and the CatalogSource** from which to pull updates. When updates are found, an appropriate **InstallPlan** is written into the namespace on behalf of the user.
3. Automated Infrastructure Management ([Over-The-Air Updates](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.1/pdf/updating_clusters/OpenShift_Container_Platform-4.1-Updating_clusters-en-US.pdf))

### New Technical Components

- **[New Installer](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install):**
    - [try.openshift.com](https://try.openshift.com/)
    - [github.com/openshift/installer](https://github.com/openshift/installer)
- **Storage:** Cloud integrated storage capability used by default via [OCS Operator](https://github.com/openshift/ocs-operator) (Red Hat)
    - There are a number of persistent storage options available to you through the OperatorHub / Storage vendors that don‚Äôt involve Red Hat, NFS or Gluster.
    - Kubernetes-native persistent storage technologies available (non-RedHat solutions):
        - [Rook-Ceph](https://operatorhub.io/operator/rook-ceph): [Rook-Ceph storage Operator now on OperatorHub.io](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rook-ceph-storage-operator-now-operatorhubio)
        - [Robin Storage Operator](https://operatorhub.io/operator/robin-operator): [get.robin.io](https://get.robin.io/)
- **Operators End-To-End!:** responsible for reconciling the system to the desired state
    - Cluster configuration kept as API objects that ease its maintenance (‚Äúeverything-as-code‚Äù approach):
        - Every component is configured with [Custom Resources (CR)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/operators/crds/crd-managing-resources-from-crds.html) that are processed by operators.
        - No more painful upgrades and synchronization among multiple nodes and no more configuration drift.
    - List of operators that configure cluster components (API objects):
        - API server
        - Nodes via Machine API
        - Ingress
        - Internal DNS
        - Logging (EFK) and Monitoring (Prometheus)
        - Sample applications
        - Networking
        - Internal Registry
        - Oauth (and authentication in general)
        - etc
- **At the Node Level:**
    - [RHEL CoreOS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/architecture/architecture-rhcos.html) is the result of merging CoreOS Container Linux and RedHat Atomic host functionality and is currently the only supported OS to host OpenShift 4.
    - Node provisioning with¬†[ignition](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-ignition.html), which came with CoreOS Container Linux
    - Atomic host updates with¬†[rpm-ostree](https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree)
    - [CRI-O](https://cri-o.io/)¬†as a container runtime
    - [SELinux](https://www.slideshare.net/openshift/openshift-18812162) enabled by default
- [Machine API](https://github.com/openshift/machine-api-operator/tree/master): Provisioning of nodes. Abstraction mechanism added (API objects to declaratively manage the cluster):
    - Based on [Kubernetes Cluster API project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api) Cluster API is a Kubernetes sub-project focused on providing declarative APIs and tooling to simplify provisioning, upgrading, and operating multiple Kubernetes clusters.
    - Provides a new set of machine resources:
        - Machine
        - Machine Deployment
        - MachineSet:
            - distributes easily your nodes among different Availability Zones
            - manages multiple node pools (e.g. pool for testing, pool for machine learning with GPU attached, etc)
- **Everything ‚Äújust another pod‚Äù**

### Installation and Cluster Autoscaler

- New installer openshift-install tool, replacement for the old Ansible scripts.
- 40 min (AWS). Terraform.
- 2 installation patterns:
    1. **Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI)**
    2. **User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI)**
- The¬†whole process can be done in one command and requires minimal infrastructure knowledge (IPI): ```openshift-install create cluster```

<center>
![OCP IPI](images/ocp-ipi.png)

![OCP IPI UPI](images/ocp_ipi_upi.png)
</center>
<br/>

#### IPI and UPI

- 2 installation patterns:
    1. **Installer Provisioned Infrastructure (IPI):** On supported platforms, the installer is capable of provisioning the underlying infrastructure for the cluster. The installer programmatically creates all portions of the networking, machines, and operating systems required to support the cluster. Think of it as best-practice reference architecture implemented in code. ¬†It is recommended that most users make use of this functionality to avoid having to provision their own infrastructure. ¬†The installer will create and destroy the infrastructure components it needs to be successful over the life of the cluster.
    2. **User Provisioned Infrastructure (UPI):** For other platforms or in scenarios where installer provisioned infrastructure would be incompatible, the installer can stop short of creating the infrastructure, and allow the platform administrator to provision their own using the cluster assets generated by the install tool. Once the infrastructure has been created, OpenShift 4 is installed, maintaining its ability to support automated operations and over-the-air platform updates.

<br/>

### Cluster Autoscaler Operator

- Adjusts the size of an OpenShift Container Platform cluster to meet its current deployment needs. It uses declarative, Kubernetes-style arguments
- Increases the size of the cluster when there are pods that failed to schedule on any of the current nodes due to insufficient resources or when another node is necessary to meet deployment needs. The ClusterAutoscaler does not increase the cluster resources beyond the limits that you specify.
- A huge improvement over the manual, error-prone process used in the previous version of OpenShift and RHEL nodes.

### Operators

#### Introduction

- Core of the platform
- The hierarchy of operators, with clusterversion at the top, is the single door for configuration changes and is responsible for reconciling the system to the desired state.
- For example, if you break a critical cluster resource directly, the system automatically recovers itself.¬†
- Similarly to cluster maintenance, [operator framework](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-operator-framework-building-apps-kubernetes)¬†used for applications. As a user, you get SDK, [OLM](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/operators/understanding_olm/olm-understanding-olm.html) (Lifecycle Manager of all Operators and their associated services running across their clusters) and embedded¬†[operator hub](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/new-kubernetes-operatorhub-red-hat-openshift-enable-hybrid-cloud-flexibility-enterprises).
- [OLM Arquitecture](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/architecture.md)
- [Adding Operators to a Cluster](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/operators/olm-adding-operators-to-cluster.html) (They can be added via **CatalogSource**)
- The supported method of using **Helm charts** with Openshift is via the [Helm Operator](https://www.openshift.com/blog/build-kubernetes-operators-from-helm-charts-in-5-steps)
- [twitter.com/operatorhubio](https://twitter.com/operatorhubio)
- View the list of Operators available to the cluster from the OperatorHub:

```bash
$ oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace
NAME AGE
amq-streams 14h
packageserver 15h
couchbase-enterprise 14h
mongodb-enterprise 14h
etcd 14h myoperator 14h
...
```

<center>
![OCP Operators](images/ocp_operators.png)
</center>
<br/>

#### Catalog

- Developer Catalog
- Installed Operators
- OperatorHub (OLM)
- Operator Management:
    - **Operator Catalogs** are groups of Operators you can make available on the cluster. They can be added via **CatalogSource** (i.e. ‚Äúcatalogsource.yaml‚Äù). Subscribe and grant a namespace access to use the installed Operators.
    - **Operator Subscriptions** keep your services up to date by tracking a channel in a package. The approval strategy determines either manual or automatic updates.

- OpenShift Container Storage based on [GlusterFS](https://www.gluster.org/) technology.
- Not OpenShift 4 compliant: Migration tooling will be available to facilitate the move to OCS 4.x (OpenShift Gluster APP Mitration Tool).

##### OCS 4 (OpenShift 4)

- **OCS Operator** based on Rook.io with Operator LifeCycle Manager (OLM).
- Tech Stack:
    - [Rook](https://rook.io) (don't confuse this with non-redhat ["Rook Ceph"](https://operatorhub.io/operator/rook-ceph) -> [RH ref](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/rook-ceph-storage-operator-now-operatorhubio)).
        - Replaces [Heketi](https://github.com/heketi/heketi)  (OpenShift 3)
        - Uses **Red Hat Ceph Storage** and **Noobaa**.
    - [Red Hat Ceph Storage](https://ceph.io)
    - [Noobaa](https://www.noobaa.io):
        - Red Hat Multi Cloud Gateway (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc)
        - Asynchronous replication of data between my local ceph and my cloud provider

#### Cluster Network Operator (CNO) & Routers

- Cluster Network Operator (CNO): The cluster network is now configured and managed by an Operator. The Operator upgrades and monitors the cluster network.
- [Router plug-ins in OCP3:](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/router/index.html)
    - A ¬´¬†route¬†¬ª is the external entrypoint to a [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/). This is one of the biggest differences between [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) and [OpenShift Enterprise¬†(= OCP)](https://www.openshift.com/) and [origin](https://www.okd.io/).
    - OpenShift router has the endpoints as targets and therefore the pod of the application.
    - [Shared/Stikcy sessions are enabled by default](https://dzone.com/articles/session-stickiness-in-openshift)
    - [HAProxy template router](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/assembly_available_router_plugins.html#architecture-haproxy-router) (default router): HTTP(s) & TLS-enabled traffic via SIN.
        - [dzone.com/articles/updating-haproxy-configurations-openshift](https://dzone.com/articles/updating-haproxy-configurations-openshift)
        - [dzone.com/articles/openshift-egress-options](https://dzone.com/articles/openshift-egress-options)
    - F5 BIG-IP Router plug-in integrates with an existing F5 BIG-IP system in your environment
    - Since the 9th May 2018,¬†[NGINX](https://www.openshift.com/blog/introducing-nginx-and-nginx-plus-routers-for-openshift)¬†is also available as ¬´¬†router¬†¬ª.
- Routers in OCP4:
    - [Ingress Controller](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/) is the most common way to allow external access to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster
    - [Configuring Ingress Operator in OCP4](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/ingress-operator.html)
    - Limited to HTTP, HTTPS using SNI, and TLS using SNI (sufficient for web applications and services)
    - Has two replicas by default, which means it should be running on two worker nodes.
    - Can be scaled up to have more replicas on more nodes.
    - The Ingress Operator implements the ingresscontroller API and is the component responsible for enabling external access to OpenShift Container Platform cluster services.
    - The operator makes this possible by deploying and managing one or more HAProxy-based¬†[Ingress Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/)¬†to handle routing.

- ServiceMesh Community Edition: [github.com/maistra/istio](https://github.com/maistra/istio)
    - Red Hat community installer compliant with OCP 4.1: [maistra.io/docs/getting_started/install](https://maistra.io/docs/getting_started/install)
    - Outcome: publicly known errors in 2 or 3 components.
- **Certified ServiceMesh Operator**
    - [ServiceMesh](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/openshift_container_platform/4.4/html-single/service_mesh/index) GA in September 2019 (available in OperatorHub):
        - [blog.openshift.com/red-hat-openshift-service-mesh-is-now-available-what-you-should-know/](https://blog.openshift.com/red-hat-openshift-service-mesh-is-now-available-what-you-should-know/)
    - Certified & Packaged by Red Hat
    - [‚ÄúOne-click‚Äù deployment](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/installing-ossm.html)
    - [Preparing to install Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/service_mesh/service_mesh_install/preparing-ossm-installation.html). To install the Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh Operator, you must first install these Operators:
        - Elasticsearch
        - Jaeger
        - Kiali
    - Do not install Community versions of the Operators. Community Operators are not supported.

#### Alerts and Silences

- Integrated Alertmanager 0.16.2 (deployed by default):
    - Monitoring -> Alerts
    - Monitoring -> Silences
    - Silences temporarily mute alerts based on a set of conditions that you define. Notifications are not sent for alerts that meet the given conditions.
- Project ‚Äúopenshift-monitoring‚Äù
- [prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/)

#### Cluster Logging (EFK)

- [thenewstack.io: Log Management for Red Hat OpenShift](https://thenewstack.io/log-management-for-red-hat-openshift/)
- EFK: Elasticsearch + Fluentd + Kibana
- Cluster Logging EFK **not deployed by default**
- As an OpenShift Container Platform cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to aggregate logs for a range of OpenShift Container Platform services.
- The OpenShift Container Platform cluster logging solution requires that you **install both the Cluster Logging Operator and Elasticsearch Operator**. There is no use case in OpenShift Container Platform for installing the operators individually. You¬†must¬†**install the Elasticsearch Operator using the CLI** following the directions below. You can **install the Cluster Logging Operator using the web console or CLI.**
Deployment procedure based on CLI + web console:
    - [docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/logging/cluster-logging-deploying.html)
    - **Elasticsearch Operator** must be installed in Project **‚Äúopenshift-operators-redhat‚Äù**
    - **Cluster Logging Operator** must be deployed in Project **‚Äúopenshift-logging‚Äù**
    - **CatalogSourceConfig** added to enable Elasticsearch Operator on the cluster
    - etc.

### Build Images. Next-Generation Container Image Building Tools

- Redesign of how images are built on the platform.
- Instead of relying on a daemon on the host to manage containers, image creation, and image pushing, we are leveraging¬†[Buildah](https://buildah.io/)¬†running inside our build pods.
- This aligns with the general OpenShift 4 theme of making everything ‚Äújust another pod‚Äù
- A simplified set of build workflows, not dependent on the node host having a specific container runtime available.¬†
- Dockerfiles that built under OpenShift 3.x will continue to build under OpenShift 4.x and S2I builds will continue to function as well.
- The actual BuildConfig API is unchanged, so a BuildConfig from a v3.x cluster can be imported into a v4.x cluster and work without modification.

## Networking and Network Policy in OCP4. SDN/CNI plug-ins

- [Networking in OCP4](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/understanding-networking.html)
- Currently, the **default OpenShift CNI is OpenShift SDN (network-policy)**, which configures an **overlay network using Open vSwitch** (OVS 2.11). The following diagram shows the CNI options for OpenShift and the status of each (supported, validated, etc. ‚Ä¶):

### Multiple Networks with SDN/CNI plug-ins. Usage scenarios for an additional network

- [Understanding multiple networks](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/networking/multiple_networks/understanding-multiple-networks.html) In Kubernetes, container networking is delegated to networking plug-ins that implement the Container Network Interface (CNI). OpenShift Container Platform uses the [Multus CNI plug-in](https://github.com/openshift/multus-cni) to allow chaining of CNI plug-ins. During cluster installation, you configure your default Pod network. The default network handles all ordinary network traffic for the cluster. You can define an additional network based on the available CNI plug-ins and attach one or more of these networks to your Pods. You can define more than one additional network for your cluster, depending on your needs. This gives you flexibility when you configure Pods that deliver network functionality, such as switching or routing.
- You can use an additional network in situations where network isolation is needed, including data plane and control plane separation. Isolating network traffic is useful for the following performance and security reasons:
    - **Performance:** You can send traffic on two different planes in order to manage how much traffic is along each plane.
    - **Security:** You can send sensitive traffic onto a network plane that is managed specifically for security considerations, and you can separate private data that must not be shared between tenants or customers.
- **All of the Pods in the cluster still use the cluster-wide default network to maintain connectivity across the cluster.** Every Pod has an eth0 interface that is attached to the cluster-wide Pod network. You can view the interfaces for a Pod by using the oc exec -it <pod_name> -- ip a command. If you add additional network interfaces that use Multus CNI, they are named net1, net2, ‚Ä¶‚Äã, netN.
- To attach additional network interfaces to a Pod, you must create configurations that define how the interfaces are attached. You specify each interface by using a Custom Resource (CR) that has a NetworkAttachmentDefinition type. A CNI configuration inside each of these CRs defines how that interface is created.

### Istio CNI plug-in

- [Istio CNI plug-in üåü](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/service_mesh/service_mesh_arch/ossm-vs-community.html#ossm-cni_ossm-vs-istio) Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh includes CNI plug-in, which provides you with an alternate way to configure application pod networking. The CNI plug-in replaces the init-container network configuration eliminating the need to grant service accounts and projects access to Security Context Constraints (SCCs) with elevated privileges.

- [openshift.com: Keep Your Applications Secure With Automatic Rebuilds üåü](https://www.openshift.com/blog/keep-your-applications-secure-with-automatic-rebuilds)
    - OpenShift Container Platform historically has addressed this challenge by using Image Streams. An image stream is an abstraction for referencing container images from within OpenShift while the referenced images are an image registry such as OpenShift internal registry, Quay, or other external registries. Image streams are capable of defining triggers which allow your builds and deployments to be automatically invoked when a new version of an image is available in the backing image registry. This in effect enables rebuilding all images that are based on a particular base image as soon as a new version of the base image is available in the Red Hat container catalog and therefore updates all images with the latest bug, CVE, and vulnerability fixes delivered in the latest base image. The challenge, however, is that this capability is limited to BuildConfigs in OpenShift and does not allow more complex workflows to be triggered when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog. Furthermore, it is also limited to the scope of a single cluster and its internal OpenShift registry.
    - Fortunately, though, using Red Hat Quay as a central registry in combination with OpenShift Pipelines enables infinite possibilities in designing sophisticated workflows for ensuring a secure software supply chain and automatically performing any set of actions whenever images are pushed, updated, or security vulnerabilities are discovered in the Red Hat container catalog.
    - In this blog post, we will highlight how Red Hat Quay can be integrated with Tekton pipelines to trigger application rebuilds when images are updated in the Red Hat container catalog. At a high level, the flow will look like this:
